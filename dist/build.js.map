\r\n\t\t\t\t——2018年3月5日，在参加十三届全国人大一次会议内蒙古代表团审议时的讲话\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br /> \r\n\t\t\t\t要把全面从严治党要求贯穿脱贫攻坚全过程，强化作风建设，完善和落实抓党建促脱贫的体制机制，发挥基层党组织带领群众脱贫致富的战斗堡垒作用，深化扶贫领域腐败和作风问题专项治理，把基层减负各项决策落到实处。\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t——2019年4月16日，在重庆主持召开解决“两不愁三保障”突出问题座谈会时的讲话

/>\r\n\t\t\t\t要解决好“谁来扶”的问题，加快形成中央统筹、省（自治区、直辖市）负总责、市（地）县抓落实的扶贫开发工作机制，做到分工明确、责任清晰、任务到人、考核到位。\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br /> \r\n\t\t\t\t越是进行脱贫攻坚战，越是要加强和改善党的领导。各级党委和政府必须坚定信心、勇于担当，把脱贫职责扛在肩上，把脱贫任务抓在手上。\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br /> \r\n\t\t\t\t要加大东部地区和中央单位对深度贫困地区的帮扶支持，强化帮扶责任，“谁的孩子谁抱”。对东西部扶贫协作和对口支援、中央单位定点帮扶的对象在深度贫困地区的，要在资金、项目、人员方面增加力度。\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br /> \r\n\t\t\t\t——2017年6月23日，在深度贫困地区脱贫攻坚座谈会上的讲话\r\n\t\t\t\t<br

\r\n\t\t\t\t各级党委和政府要把“两不愁三保障”各项措施落实到村、到户、到人。要加强乡村两级基层党组织建设，更好发挥在脱贫攻坚中的战斗堡垒作用，提高党在基层的治理能力和服务群众能力。党员干部要到脱贫攻坚的一线、到带领群众脱贫致富的火热实践中历练，经受考验，磨练党性，增进群众感情，增强做好工作的本领。\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t<br />
